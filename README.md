# Issues

1. Takes a lot of time due to inconsequential actions (I prefer fix number 2 due to lack of resources and time)
  * Can penalize such actions using same network (Network has to learn and is agnostic)
  * Can bar such actions using hard-coded restrictions (Network knows which actions)
  
2. Code Readability

3. Extensions :
  * Target Network
  * Double DQN
  * Dueling Network
  * Prioritized Replay
  * Actor-Critic (A3C)?
