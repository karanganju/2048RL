# Issues

1. Takes a lot of time due to inconsequential actions (I prefer fix number 2 due to lack of resources and time)
   * Can penalize such actions using same network (Network has to learn and is agnostic)
   * Can bar such actions using hard-coded restrictions (Network knows which actions)

2. Target Network takes a lot of time!!!
  
3. Code Readability

4. Play with Hyperparams

5. Extensions :
   * Double DQN
   * Dueling Network
   * Prioritized Replay
   * Actor-Critic (A3C)?
